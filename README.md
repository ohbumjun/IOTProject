Photovoltaic(PV) solar panels in real-tim

# BackGround
Amongst renewable energy sources, solar power energy is gaining popularity thanks to low carbon dioxide emission and increasing efficiency. 

Photovoltaic(PV) solar panels are one of the ways to harness solar power into renewable energy with only a major initial cost but low maintenance. 

However, due to the tendency of solar energy systems being far away from the electricity users, energy health monitoring in real time and maintaining recovery from faults is the key goal. 

Our Application provide a way to interact and maintain an off-grid solar energy system from many miles away based on IOT Technology.

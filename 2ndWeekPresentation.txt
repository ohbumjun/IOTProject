Hi I Am Bumjun Oh from Team Project 4
Will start the presentation

Firstly, I will Introduce What we have done
during last week

1) We worked on Basic setup
2) Changed our goal
3) Puchased Equipment

1) We Worked on Basic setup
ex) prepare server, db, aws instance, deployment etc
2) We changed our goal :
from analying datas to network communction between remote places
3) Purchased basic equipments for our projects
- based on the purchased equipments,  it seems like we will
be working on experiment in a small scale

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My presentation consists of 3 main contents
1) introducing basic setup
2) short term goal of our project
3) Basic Concept of Solar Controller, Raspberry Pi, & Interaction 
between them

>> 1) Basic Set-up
- we worked basic server,db and deployed on the web
on which we are going to work on

>> 2) Short Term Goal
- we will be focusing on a way to communitcate between romote places
- There are different types of network technology that allows communication
between device in different areas
ex) Wi-fi, BlueTooth, LTE
common problem of these technologies are that they are expensive,
or they work in short-distances

since we want to make a project that monitors the
health of solar power system from very far place , 
we will be using LoRa .

Lora is one of network technology that allows communications
between devices in remote place,
and rather than buying additional equipments for Lora,
we will try to make our own LoRa gateway

>> 3) Lastly, About Solar controller & Rasberry pi
- Hardship we faced is, how we are going to connect rasberry pi, to solar charge 
contoller 
In order to make,organize datas from controller, we should find a way
for rasberry pi device to accept the data from controller,
but we are having a hard time finding a appropriate way

wonder whether there is additional cable needed or
special type of controoler that is suitable for connecting with Rasberry pi device

Advice
